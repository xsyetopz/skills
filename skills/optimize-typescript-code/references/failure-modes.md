# Failure modes and recovery

| Failure mode | What it looks like | Required recovery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Benchmark mismatch** | Different input, compiler/runtime, flags, hardware, setup, or work is compared. | Match identities or state why comparison is invalid. |
| **Correctness sacrifice** | Validation, errors, ordering, cancellation, or work is removed. | Restore contract and use independent oracle. |
| **One-run confidence** | A single noisy result becomes a speedup claim. | Repeat, analyze variance, and inspect raw results. |
| **Profile-free tuning** | Technique chosen from folklore or syntax aesthetics. | Profile representative workload first. |
| **Debug/release conflation** | Debug or different optimization/target settings decide production performance. | Measure deployable configuration. |
| **Micro-to-system overreach** | Microbenchmark result becomes application/production claim. | Run component/end-to-end target metric. |
| **Tool maximalism** | Every profiler/benchmark is run without a decision question. | Use cheapest sufficient evidence path. |
| **Environment drift** | Candidate implicitly upgrades runtime/dependencies or uses native CPU flags. | Match or treat as separate authorized change. |
| **Type/runtime conflation** | Faster type check is claimed as runtime speed or vice versa. | Measure and report each pipeline separately. |
| **Type stripping** | Node/Bun execution of `.ts` is treated as `tsc` compatibility. | Run project compiler/type checks with exact tsconfig. |
| **Public type weakening** | Simpler types become `any`/broader and hide errors. | Preserve declaration/API contract and type tests. |
| **Incremental cache** | Warm stale cache makes build look fast or wrong. | Measure cold/warm explicitly and verify invalidation. |
| **Emit drift** | tsconfig/target change alters modules/helpers/runtime support. | Inspect emitted/package outputs and consumers. |

## Recovery discipline

Preserve the first useful error and the state that produced it. Stop dependent
work when a prerequisite is false. Change strategy when another equivalent edit
or retry cannot produce new evidence. Undo only attributable experimental
changes; never reset or overwrite unrelated user work to obtain a clean result.

Do not convert a failure into success by swallowing the error, weakening the
assertion, regenerating an unexplained snapshot, adding speculative fallback
behavior, or reporting an intermediate checkpoint as the completed task.
